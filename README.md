##  Project Description

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam). The project uses the classic SMS Spam Collection Dataset and is built using the scikit-learn library.

It covers all essential steps in a typical machine learning workflow: data loading, preprocessing, training, evaluating, and visualizing results.

---

##  Problem Statement

With the proliferation of text messaging, spam messages have become a major nuisance and a threat to security. Automatic spam detection systems are crucial for filtering these messages before they reach the user.

---

##  Objectives

* Load and explore a real-world SMS spam dataset
* Preprocess text using Bag-of-Words vectorization
* Train a classification model (Naive Bayes)
* Evaluate the model with standard metrics
* Visualize results using a confusion matrix

---

##  Key Features

* Reads SMS Spam dataset from an online URL
* Preprocesses text using CountVectorizer
* Encodes labels as binary values (0 for ham, 1 for spam)
* Splits dataset into training and test sets
* Trains a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier
* Evaluates using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
* Visualizes confusion matrix with heatmap

---

##  Technologies Used

* **Python 3.7+**
* **Pandas** – Data manipulation
* **Scikit-learn** – ML tools and metrics
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization

##  Sample Use Cases

*  **Email/SMS Filtering**: Automatically detect and block spam messages
*  **Academic Learning**: Understand basics of NLP and classification
*  **Data Science Practice**: Learn and apply text vectorization
*  **ML Model Building**: Explore preprocessing and evaluation steps

---

##  Learning Outcomes

* Learn how to load and process real-world text datasets
* Understand and apply bag-of-words vectorization
* Train and evaluate a Naive Bayes model
* Interpret accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
* Create and visualize confusion matrices

---

##  Limitations

* Dataset is small and binary-labeled (no multi-labels)
* Simple text vectorization; does not use TF-IDF or deep embeddings
* No GUI or API deployment
* Model not fine-tuned for edge cases

---

##  Future Enhancements

* Use TF-IDF or word embeddings for better text representation
* Integrate a GUI for ease of use
* Expand dataset for more accuracy
* Deploy as a web or mobile application
* Add cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
